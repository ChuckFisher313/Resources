Raw notes from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk

Best practice is to place javascript script tag at the end of the body because it's better if the browser loads the HTML before trying to load the javascript. 

Inline 
<script> 
    // comment 
    console.log('Hello World');
</script> 

In a separate file. 
<Script src="script.js"/>

Node is a runtime environment for executing javascript code. 



VARIABLES 

let name = 'Chuck'; 

"let" is indicating the variable "name" is the variable. End with semi colon. Single quotes on strings is a best practice. 

(Using var to indicate variables has some kind of problem)

Variable names best practices 
    Cannot be a reserved word. (if is an example)
    Cannot start with a number.
    Cannot contain a space or hyphen.
    Camel case is the most common.
    Variable names are case sensitive. 

Types: 
    Primitives 
        strings - let name = 'Chuck'; 
        numbers - let age = '38';
        boolean - let isApproved = true; 
        undefined - let firstName; (don't set it to anything and it'll be undefined.) Undefined is a type AND a value. 
        null - let selectedColor - null; (use when you want to clear the value in a variable ) null is an object.

 Dynamic Typing: 
    There are two types of languages, static languages and dynamic languages. In static languages the type of a variable cannot be changed. In dynamic languages, the type can be changed. Variable type is determined at runtime based on what the value is at that time. 

    Integer vs floating point. All numbers in javascript are of type Number. 

Reference Types: 
    Objects - Something that has properties.
        There are two ways to work with objects. 
            1. Dot notation - person.name = 'John';   or console.log(person.name); Most used way. 
            2. Bracket notation - person['name'] = 'Mary'; 
            Used when you might not know the property at runtime. 
    Arrays - List of objects. 
        let selectedColors = ['red', 'blue'];  This is an array with two values. 
        console.log(selectedColors[1]); This would return the value in the array index 1.
        selected colors[2] = 'green'; This would add a third item to the array. 
        Javascript allows different types in an array. 
        An array is technically an object in Javascript. 
        There are inherent properties in any array, assigned by default such as, every, fill, filter, find, findIndex, etc. 
        Length property is a commonly used array property which identifies how many things are in an array. 
    Function - Fundamental building block in js that performs a task or calculates a value. 
        Function syntax:       
        function greet() {
            console.log('Hello World');
        }
        No semi colon at the end of a function. 
        
        Calling a function syntax: 
        greet(); 

Functions can have inputs. 

function greet (name) {
    console.log('Hello ' + name);
}
greet ('John'); 
greet('Chuck'); 
    
    *** name is a parameter. 
    *** John is an argument. 

    Object Example 
    let person = {
        name: 'Chuck',
        age: 30
    }

function greet(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log('Hello' + firstName + ' lastName)
}
greet ('Chuck',  'Fisher');

Second example of a function, calculating a value. 

function square(number) {
    return number * number;
}

let number = square(2);
or 
console.log(square(2));

Console.log is a function. 



CONSTANTS 

Value of constants can't change. 

const interestRate = 0.3; 

If you try to change a constant, it'll throw an error.
